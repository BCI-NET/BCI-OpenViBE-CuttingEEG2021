# Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) using OpenViBE, an open-source software platform

Hands-on tutorial organized during the [5th Symposium on cutting-edge methods for EEG research, October 4 – 7, 2021](https://cuttingeeg2021.org)

Hands-on tutorial Session #3 - Wednesday, October 6, 8:30am – 11:30am (CEST)

Organizers:

* Arthur Desbois, Research Engineer, Aramis team-project, Inria Paris, Paris Brain Institute

## Abstract
TBD + outline

## Audience/Prerequisites
TBD + Windows/Linux + openvibe version to download

## Objectives
TBD


## Timetable
### Introduction

### Part 1, talks and Q&A
* What is BCI? Context, paradigms and applications
* What is OpenViBE? 
* Concrete examples of use of OpenViBE
* How does OpenViBE work?
* Q&A-1

### Part 2, BCI-CuttingEEG protocol and Q&A
We will perform a simulation of motor imagery-based BCI experiment with a virtual subject. To this end, we will use OpenViBE to extract, preprocess and classify the EEG data.

* Chapter 0 - Prerequisites before performing a BCI experiment

* Chapter 1 - BCI-CuttingEEG protocol set-up

* Chapter 2 - Features extraction and selection

* Chapter 3 - Training/Running

* Q&A-2

### Concluding remarks & Perspectives
* BONUS - OpenViBE
* BONUS - BCI current challenges
